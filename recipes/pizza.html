    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped
      with
      tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple,
      meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop
        while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .
      </li>
      <li>
        For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well
        blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is
        formed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed.
        (If
        using RapidRiseÂ® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit
        pans.
